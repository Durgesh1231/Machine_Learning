        "# Q1: Explanation:\n",
        "# A) Artificial Intelligence (AI): AI is a broad field of computer science that aims to create systems capable of performing tasks that would typically require human intelligence.\n",
        "#    Example: Virtual assistants like Siri or Google Assistant that can understand voice commands and perform tasks.\n",
        "#\n",
        "# B) Machine Learning (ML): ML is a subset of AI that enables systems to learn from data and improve over time without being explicitly programmed.\n",
        "#    Example: Email spam filters that learn to identify spam messages based on user feedback.\n",
        "#\n",
        "# C) Deep Learning (DL): DL is a subset of ML that uses neural networks with many layers (deep neural networks) to analyze large amounts of data for complex tasks.\n",
        "#    Example: Self-driving cars that use deep learning to process data from cameras, sensors, and maps to navigate roads.\n",
        "#\n",
        "# D) Data Science (DS): Data science involves extracting insights and knowledge from data using techniques from statistics, ML, and computer science.\n",
        "#    Example: Analyzing sales data to predict future trends in a retail business.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Q2: Supervised Learning: Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on labeled data (input-output pairs).\n",
        "#     Examples:\n",
        "#     - Spam email classification (labeled emails: spam or not spam).\n",
        "#     - Predicting house prices based on features like size, location, and number of rooms.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Q3: Unsupervised Learning: Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on unlabeled data and finds patterns or structures in the data.\n",
        "#     Examples:\n",
        "#     - Clustering customers into different segments based on their behavior.\n",
        "#     - Anomaly detection in network security to identify unusual patterns that may indicate a security breach.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Q4: Differences between AI, ML, DL, and DS:\n",
        "#     - AI: Focuses on creating intelligent systems that simulate human-like decision-making.\n",
        "#     - ML: A subset of AI that uses data to train models and improve performance.\n",
        "#     - DL: A specialized subset of ML that uses deep neural networks to handle complex data.\n",
        "#     - DS: Involves analyzing and interpreting data to extract meaningful insights and predictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Q5: Differences between supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised learning:\n",
        "#     - Supervised learning: Uses labeled data for training the model, where the output is known.\n",
        "#     - Unsupervised learning: Uses unlabeled data, and the model identifies patterns and structures without predefined labels.\n",
        "#     - Semi-supervised learning: Combines labeled and unlabeled data to improve model accuracy, particularly when labeled data is scarce.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Q6: Train, Test, and Validation Split:\n",
        "#     - Training set: Used to train the model and learn patterns from the data.\n",
        "#     - Validation set: Used to fine-tune the model and select the best hyperparameters.\n",
        "#     - Test set: Used to evaluate the model's final performance after training and validation.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Q7: Unsupervised learning in anomaly detection:\n",
        "#     - In unsupervised learning, algorithms like clustering or density estimation can be used to identify outliers or unusual data points that deviate from normal behavior.\n",
        "#     - Example: Identifying fraudulent transactions in financial systems by detecting anomalies in transaction data.\n",
